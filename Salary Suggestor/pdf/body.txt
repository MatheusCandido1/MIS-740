Full family medical coverage will be provided through our company's employee benefit plan and will be effective on June 1. Dental and optical insurance are also available. The company offers a flexible paid time-off plan which includes vacation, personal and sick leave. Time off accrues at the rate of one day per month for your first year, then increased based on your tenure with the company. Eligibility for the company retirement plan begins 90 days after your start date.

If you choose to accept this job offer, please sign the second copy of this letter and return it to me at your earliest convenience.

When your acknowledgment is received, we will send you employee benefit enrollment forms and an employee handbook that details our benefit plans and retirement plan. We look forward to welcoming you at our company.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can provide any additional information.
